From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project. And it’s all open source.

    "In this case let's look on how we built the code in [section 2](./02_Sending_Data.ipynb), Publishing to the Lightring. Running `ros2 topic list -t`, one of the lines we get back is `/cmd_lightring [irobot_create_msgs/msg/LightringLeds]`. What this line means is that the **topic** is `/cmd_lightring`, and the type of **message** that are sent and recieved from that topic are `irobot_create_msgs/msg/LightringLeds`. Inspecting the code in [section 2](./02_Sending_Data.ipynb), the message type appears on line 6. \n",
