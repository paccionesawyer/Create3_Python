    "There is no way to combine subscribers and publishers from the command line; however, there is in python! Let's combine the examples we used in [Section 1](./01_Getting_Data.ipynb) and in [Section 3](./03_Sending_Actions.ipynb); however, this time, let's switch it up a bit. We will subsribe to the `/hazard_detection` topic and send actions to the `/turn_angle` goal. \n",
