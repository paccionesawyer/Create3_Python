    "# Actions - Sending Actions to the Create3 \n",
    "\n",
    "Actions are one of the communication types in ROS 2 and are intended for long running tasks. They consist of three parts: a goal, feedback, and a result. Action clients send goal requests to action servers. Action servers send goal feedback and results to action clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this from the command-line, we use the command `ros2 action send_goal <action_name> <action_type> <values>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `<action_name>` argument is just like the `<topic_name>` used in the previous cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<action_type>` argument is similar to the `<msg_type>` argument and defines the category of action you are communicating to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<values>` argument is similar to the `'<args>'` argument is the actual data youâ€™ll pass to the topic. Let's set it to `\"{}\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case let's tell our Create3 to Undock itself, this will only work if the Create3 is currently docked (i.e. connected to its charger.)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<action_name> = /undock\n",
    "<action_type> = irobot_create_msgs/action/Undock\n",
    "<values> = \"{}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Typically the `ros2 action send_goal` command is called from the command-line of a terminal, here we use the `%%bash` magic word to simulate the command line in this jupyter notebook."
